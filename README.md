# LOAN_ELIGIBILITY_MODEL

# Loan Eligibility Prediction 

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan eligibility for applicants using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment components.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering.
- Model training: Using various machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbour,random forest,Xg Boost,Voting classifier.
- Model evaluation: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deployment: Deployment of the trained model for real-time predictions.

## Requirements
- Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn,Matplotlib, Django (for deployment).
